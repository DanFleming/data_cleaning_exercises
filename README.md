A short exercise to practice data cleaning
(requires pandas and NumPy)

1. Create simple DataFrame (df) (some errors are intentionally put in for the exercise)
2. Display info of df
3. Check missing values with df.isnull()
4. Check data types with df.dtypes
5. Converting dates to consistent format with pd.to_datetime
6. Find outliers in price range (sample < 0)
7. Find duplicates with subsets CustomerName and Product
8. Standardize text data in CustomerName column (remove whitespace and correct capitalisation)
9. Validate sample price range 0 - 1200 to find invalid prices
